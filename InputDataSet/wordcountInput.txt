 Expand German Die Weber date March 2011 The Weavers lang de Die Weber Silesian German lang sli De Waber is a play written by the German playwright Gerhart Hauptmann in 1892. Plot summary Most of the characters are proletarians struggling for their rights. Unlike most plays of any period as pointed out many times in literature criticism and introductions the play has no true central character providing ample opportunities for ensemble acting. Production history The Weavers was staged on Broadway in 1915 1916. The Weavers at the Internet Broadway Database Criticism Barrett H. Clark s comments as one of Gerhart Hauptmann s experiments in dramatic form The Weavers is highly significant. Instead of a hero he has created a mob this mob is therefore the protagonist—or chief character—and if individuals emerge from the rank and file they are not thrust into the foreground to stay long. It is the weavers as a class that are ever before us and the unity of the play is in them and in them alone they are only parts of a larger picture which will take shape as the story advances and are not intended to be taken as important individuals.

The Conflagration Der rote Hahn 1901 is a German play written by Gerhart Hauptmann 1862–1946 . Like Henrik Ibsen Hauptmann focuses attention on social issues. Unlike The Weavers play 1892 and The Assumption of Hannele 1893 this play does not seem to have been performed on Broadway. However it has been adapted as a German film 1962 . The director was John Olden starring Rudolf Platte as Schuhmachermeister Fielitz and Inge Meysel as Frau Fielitz. Dramatic characters scene and period col begin col 2 Fielitz cobbler Mrs. Fielitz his wife Leontine her oldest daughter by her first marriage Schmarowski architect and son in law to the Fielitz Langheinrich smith Rauchhaupt retired Prussian constable Gustav his oldest son congenital imbecile Mieze Lottle Trude Lenchen Lieschen Mariechen Tienchen Hannchen his daughters Dr. Boxer physician of Jewish birth Von Wehrhahn justice col 2 Ede journeyman at Langheinrich s Glasenapp clerk in the Justice s Court Schulze constable Mrs. Schulze his aunt Tschache constable A fireman A boy Janitor of the Court Village people col end Scene In the neighbourhood of Berlin around 1901 Plot Fielitz a cobbler is arguing with his wife who wants them to stop toiling for nothing.

Neighbors arrive as well Langheinrich a smith and Rauchhaupt a retired constable. They make comments about the iron cross inscribed by Rauchhaupt on the grave of her former husband. Later Langheinrich receives the visit of Dr Boxer who has returned after being at sea for several years. Gustav Rauchhaupt s mentally handicapped son enters briskly excited making sounds from his mouth seeming like a trumpet. He drops a box of matches. There is a fire at the Fielitz house Langheinrich being called as a voluntary fireman. The business is investigated by Wehrhahn who concludes contrary to his father s belief that Gustav is guilty and must be sent away. Despite Rauchhaupt s suspicions the Fielitz are never found out. They profit by it together with their family including their prosperous son in law to their daughter Schmarowski an architect. Nevertheless the stress of the experience seems to have affected Fielitz brain Mrs Fielitz feels poorly and just as Fielitz bursts in the room exclaiming Me ... me ... me ... me ... it was me that did it his wife wanders her arms thrashing about and dies.

Excavations produced artifacts made from non local materials such as Greenstone copper and galena and distinctive projectile points that did not originate at the site or even in Mississippi. Similar high prestige exotic goods were also found at Pharr Mounds a nearby contemporaneous site which show the local peoples involvement with the Hopewell exchange system long distance trade network and religious network.

 Infobox person name Jimmy Nelson image birth_date Birth date and age 1928 12 15 birth_place Chicago Illinois US death_date death_place birth_name Jimmy Nelson occupation Ventriloquist years_active 1945 spouse Margot Humphries 1947 1951 Betty Norman 1956 Jimmy Nelson born December 15 1928 is an American ventriloquist who appeared on television in the 1950s and 1960s. He was famous for commercials for Nestlé chocolate featuring his puppet Farfel the dog. He hosted a children s show sponsored by Nestlé. Early life Jimmy Nelson was born in Chicago Illinois on December 15 1928. When he was ten years old his aunt won a toy ventriloquist s dummy named Dummy Dan in a Bingo game and gave it to her nephew for Christmas. He learned ventriloquism and a year later his father upgraded the dummy s mouth control from a simple string and loop to a lever system like those used in professional ventriloquist s dummies. cite web url title Jimmy Nelson Warm Memories of Danny O Day Farfel Chaaawwwwclate author J.C. Johnson publisher Talking Comedy.com year 2005 accessdate 2010 11 16 Nelson began taking Dan to school where his fourth grade teacher allowed him to use the dummy when speaking in front of the class. In this way Nelson taught himself to overcome his fear of public speaking. He soon started using jokes in his presentation discovering he could make his classmates laugh. He then started performing for church groups schools and American Legion posts. By the time he was a teenager he started earning money competing in amateur talent contests held at the local movie theatres where the prize was five dollars for the most popular act. Professional career In 1945 Nelson asked famed Chicago ventriloquist figure maker Frank Marshall to make him a professional quality dummy. Marshall who had made Edgar Bergen s Charlie McCarthy and Paul Winchell s Jerry Mahoney would only do this after seeing the ventriloquist s work. He came to one of Nelson s theatre performances and was impressed so sold Nelson a custom made dummy which he always carved to bear a resemblance to the ventriloquist. Nelson gave Dummy Dan s replacement the full name Danny O Day which he chose because it contained none of the consonants impossible for ventriloquists to say without moving the lips unlike McCarthy and Mahoney . He then hired a manager and started touring professionally. By 1947 Nelson was a professional success and Danny O Day began to show signs of wear so Nelson hired Marshall to build him a second one. However Marshall s hand carved originals which he tailored to the personality of the ventriloquist were impossible to duplicate identically and Nelson felt the second dummy didn t look sufficiently like Danny to replace him. So he decided to maintain Danny and added heavy eyebrows eyeglasses and a beret to the new dummy creating a foil for Danny named Humphrey Higsbye. In September 1950 Nelson made his first appearance with Danny on The Ed Sullivan Show. Farfel the dog One night that year while working a late show in a Wichita Kansas nightclub he picked up a stuffed dog a patron had left on the piano and improvised a low pitched voice to make it talk. This gave him the idea for a new character which he had Marshall build. He named it Farfel after the Jewish pasta dish he had seen on the menu of the Borscht Belt resorts in upstate New York where he performed. Television career In 1950 Nelson was hired as a regular on the Texaco Star Theatre TV show hosted by Milton Berle. Nelson and Danny O Day would appear in Texaco gas jockey uniforms. At one point he added another animal dummy to his character repertoire a cat named Ftatateeta after a character in George Bernard Shaw s play Caesar and Cleopatra. Nestlé commercials In 1955 the Nestlé company hired Nelson to do commercials selling their chocolate candy and Nestlé s Quik chocolate milk flavoring. The Nestlé executives had him audition by spontaneously performing their newly written jingle. Nelson sang the first two musical lines in Danny s voice N E S T L E S Nestlé s makes the very best... He finished with Farfel slowly singing the last word chocolate in two syllables. Nelson was so nervous that his hands sweated and when Farfel was finished his finger slipped off the control causing the mouth to audibly snap shut a mistake no ventriloquist should make. Nelson left the audition thinking he had blown it but was surprised to learn he was hired in fact the executives actually liked the mouth snapping effect and asked that he keep it. This became his trademark as the commercials ran for ten years. When advertising Nestlé s Quik Danny O Day would say it makes milk taste...like a million dollars again slowly and pausing for effect.

The Paiján culture was an archaeological culture that developed on the northern coast of Peru between 8 700 and 5 900 BCE. Tom Dillehay et al The first settlers p. 21. It was first described by Peruvian archaeologist Rafael Larco Hoyle in the 1940s from the Pampa de los Fósiles site. Tom Dillehay The Settlement of the Americas p. 145. Later research mainly by French archaeologist Claude Chauchat identified dozens of open air sites which include camps workshops and quarries. Danièle Lavallée The first South Americans pp. 97–98. Most findings are concentrated along the valleys of the rivers Jequetepeque Cupisnique Chicama and Moche in the northern coast of Peru more limited evidences of Paiján presence have been found in the central and south coasts of Peru as well as in the highland site of El Inga in Ecuador. Tom Dillehay The Settlement of the Americas pp. 145–146. The Paiján environment was arid with sparse vegetation and small animals such as rodents lizards and snails further resources were provided by the sea which at the time was located 15 kilometers farther than today due to a .lower sea level. Danièle Lavallée The first South Americans p. 98. To adapt to this environment the Paiján developed long needle–like projectile points which were mounted on hollow shafts of cane or reed and be used as harpoons to catch fish they also collected snails hunted small animals such as vizcachas and used grinding stones to process plants. Michael Moseley The Incas and their ancestors pp. 93–94. Early Paiján sites dated between 8 600 and 8 000 BCE indicate large bands that moved seasonally between the coastal plains and the western slopes of the Andes later sites dated between 8 000 and 6 500 BCE evidence smaller groups of decreased mobility. Tom Dillehay et al The first settlers pp. 21–22. According to anthropologist Tom Dillehay a possible explanation for this change is that an amelioration of the climate increased the availability of wild plants and animals thus Paiján people required less movement to meet their requirements while still relying on hunting gathering.

Its premiere in the Lyttelton auditorium of the Royal National Theatre was directed by Howard Davies. British revivals of the play have included one at the Salisbury Playhouse in 2001 and at the Lyric Theatre London in 2003. Hare later adapted it as 1993 film of the same title also directed by Davies. It is set in 1980s Britain and examines the impact of Thatcherism on personal relationships within the family of a junior government minister after her father s death. Hare states that its title refers to a nun s feeling of ecstasy on being received by God at the moment of her death rather than the Protestant concept of the Rapture. Synopsis Estranged sisters Isobel and Marion are forced to reunite when their father dies and they must decide how to handle Katherine their young alcoholic mentally unstable stepmother who has been left nothing but the rural home in which they were raised. Isobel and her lover Irwin own a small graphic design company that is struggling to stay afloat. Her sister suggests she and her born again Christian husband Tom help them expand the business by finding investors and making Katherine a partner responsible for finding new business. Isobel has grave misgivings about the plan but finally agrees to it when Marion convinces Irwin of its potential success. Before long the strain of running the expanded business causes a deterioration in Isobel s relationship with Irwin who is becoming increasingly dependent upon her while at the same time Katherine s tenuous hold on sanity begins to unravel. Plot Act 1 Scene 1 Isobel is sitting with the body of her father Robert who has just died. Her elder sister Marion arrives to claim a ring she had given him and the two sisters begin to argue. Marion s husband Tom arrives and Marion leaves angry with Isobel then Tom and Isobel talk before leaving. Scene 2 Isobel and her father s second wife the alcoholic Katherine sit in the garden of Robert s house just after his funeral. Marion and Tom arrive and an argument begins when Katherine suddenly introduces her idea that she would like to join Isobel s small design firm. Katherine storms out and finds a hidden bottle of drink before returning whereupon the previously doubtful Isobel agrees that Katherine can join the firm. Scene 3 In the office of Isobel s firm she and her lover Irwin attempt to enjoy a rare evening without Katherine until Katherine arrives to tell them how she has taken Isobel s friend Max out to dinner. Katherine criticises Irwin s design work before leaving and Irwin tries to convince Isobel to get rid of her. Katherine returns and when Isobel proves unable or unwilling to eject Katherine Irwin intervenes and asks Katherine to leave in the morning. Katherine leaves temporarily and Isobel refuses to agree to her ejection from the firm. Scene 4 Back at Robert s house Marion and Tom try to convince Isobel to let them invest in her firm to help it expand with Irwin betraying Isobel by supporting them rather than her. Act 2 Scene 1 Marion s secretary Rhonda comes round to Isobel s firm s new offices for a shower and she and Irwin flirt over a bottle of champagne until Isobel arrives back unexpectedly. Rhonda leaves for the shower and Isobel reveals that Katherine has stabbed one of the firm s clients and so has had to be put into a rehab clinic. Isobel and Irwin argue and Rhonda returns to the office before leaving to go to the cinema. Isobel surprises her and Irwin by suggesting that they come too and the three leave together. Scene 2 The expansion of Isobel s firm having failed Marion and Tom wait in Tom s office to which Irwin comes for a business meeting. He tells them how Isobel left the cinema halfway through the film and took a spur of the moment holiday to Lanzarote before returning to care for Katherine. He also admits how he is still in love with Isobel despite the friction that now exists between them and Marion criticises her sister s handling of the situation. Isobel arrives and refuses to come into the office until Irwin leaves. Irwin leaves Isobel enters and she and Marion argue until Isobel finally leaves. A born again evangelical Christian Tom then criticises Marion and leaves to pray for Isobel and Irwin. Scene 3 In the lounge of Katherine s flat Isobel attempts to make her dinner and the two talk before preparing a sofa bed for Isobel to stay the night. Katherine leaves for her bedroom and Isobel settles down to read before Irwin arrives thanks to Katherine who has secretly disobeyed Isobel and unbolted to door so he can get in.

Isobel then prepares to go out and Irwin shoots her just as she leaves. Scene 4 Back at Robert s house Marion Tom and Katherine reinstate its furniture and prepare for Isobel s funeral.

History New York Social Services Before HRA Social services in some form have existed in New York City since shortly after the first settlers came to what was then the Dutch colony of New Amsterdam in the 1600s. Early programs were usually run by churches and private charities. As an English colony New York’s social services were based on the Elizabethan Poor Law of 1598 1601 in which the poor who could not work were cared for in a Poorhouse. Those who could were employed in a Workhouse. The first Poorhouse in New York was created in the 1740s and was a combined Poorhouse Workhouse and House of Corrections. As poverty increased in the 1800s more private charities and public initiatives were created to deal with the issue. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries many social work based private charities merged with government agencies and New York became a leader in developing social work oriented public service organizations. The Great Depression was a catalyst for social service organizations to go further in addressing the needs of the poor and unemployed across the nation and the New Deal led to an expansion in the type and amount of aid provided to low income families and increased cooperation between public and private social service providers. Creation of HRA The Human Resources Administration Department of Social Services was created on August 15 1966 by consolidating many of the city’s existing social service administrations under Mayor John Lindsay’s Executive Order No. 28. The city agencies combined to form HRA included HRA Central Operations and the Department of Welfare the Manpower and Career Development Agency the Community Development Agency Youth Services Agency and Addiction Services Agency. The Administration initially had two chief officers the Administrator of the Human Resources Administration and the Commissioner of the Department of Social Services. In 1970 these positions were combined into the office of Commissioner. HRA was initially created as a ‘super agency ’ housing all of the city’s social service programs. In 1993 the Department of Homeless Services DHS became a separate city agency and in 1996 the Administration for Children’s Services ACS was also separated from HRA. Welfare Reform In 1996 President Bill Clinton signed the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act PRWORA more commonly known as welfare reform. This required social services agencies around the country to shift to a work first philosophy that emphasized job training and employment services combined with temporary aid and work supports. The Aid to Families with Dependent Children AFDC program was replaced nationwide with Temporary Assistance to Needy Families TANF . In 1998 the first phase of welfare reform was implemented in New York City under HRA Commissioner Jason Turner. The Agency’s Income Support Centers were converted to Job Centers. Since the implementation of reforms in New York City the Cash Assistance Caseload has declined to its lowest level since 1964 while enrollment in work support programs like Food Stamps has increased.

Please do not edit pages without concern at least such a major destruction or you will be blocked from editing. 2 Desphilic is almost the only Persian Romanization site which is still alive. It definitely deserves a separate page in Wikipedia. 3 If this census has a primary leader or judge or jurry plz that leader be responsible to look for consultancy about the topic from an expert. The contents should not be judged without comments from an expert. 4 The contents if compared to Chinese Romanization should be considered with the following issues taken in mind 41 Chinese have more than 3000 alphabet letters while Perso Arabic has only 32 which amongst them 10 are repetitions. 42 Chinese have 1 4 of the world population Perso Arabic Persian users are only 70 Million. 43 Desphilic is a new and under development standard. however currently there are 1000 results in Google. It is obvious that you must find more results for pinyin. and of course its wiki page is larger. 5 The issues that criticizers have talked about all are about quantitative matters. none of them have had a qualitative and content based analysis. —Preceding unsigned comment added by I masoomi talk • contribs 10 17 23 November 2010 UTC Reply Copyrighted material cannot be added to Wikipedia without confirmation of permission. If you do have permission then you need to follow the instructions for donating copyrighted material. Being nearly the only Persian Romanization website around is not a reason for keeping this article unless it can be shown that this fact makes the site notable through coverage in reliable sources. This discussion does not have a specific leader. It is a community discussion although an uninvolved administrator will make a decision at the end based on this discussion. As for judgment from an expert if anybody can out forth evidence from experts that Desphilic is a notable Persian romanisation then that would be a strong argument for keeping the article. Pointing to the Chinese language was not to compare the details of the language but rather show that coverage about Chinese Romanisation exists in reliable sources. A search in Google Books for pinyin or Wade Giles shows plenty of sources that write about these systems of Romansiation.. whereas there is absolutely no results for Desphilic.

Jehochman Talk 20 02 17 November 2010 UTC 2010 Shanghai fire la 2010 Shanghai fire – View AfD View log • plainlink 1 Shanghai fire .html 2 Afd statistics Find sources 2010 Shanghai fire I fail to see how this is a notable event in any sense of the word. Wikipedia is an encyclopedia not a news archive and this is purely news. The fact that it has had international coverage is great and all but in the end it is simply not encyclopedic material. In a few months this is not going to be remembered at all and thus it has no enduring notability at all. This was just yet another fire that for some reason caught the attention of today s media. That last half does not contribute anything to notability and our policies only mention that it might indicate notability not that it does . Sh i r ik Questions or Comments? 18 19 16 November 2010 UTC Hmm Are there any specific policies on the notability of disasters? I m fairly certain that it s pretty common practice to keep articles on catastrophes of this scale. That s 50+ deaths in on incident. Anyway there s tones of articles of accidents of a similar nature see CATEGORY 2010 fires for just a few. In that light not only do I vote Keep but I propose that this AfD be dropped as per WP SNOW. Johnsemlak talk 18 28 16 November 2010 UTC Disasters? It s a fire. I looked at the category surely you can agree with me when I argue that there s a little bit of a difference between a power plant explosion or a church burning and an apartment fire. One of them happens every day one of them does not. What the media happens to decide is relevant is not only something a coin flip might be able to tell you but also something that should not impact what Wikipedia is. Sh i r ik Questions or Comments? 18 59 16 November 2010 UTC Keep . See . eg. 2010 Connecticut power plant explosion 5 dead 27 injured 2010 Shanghai fire at least 53 dead at least 100 injured so far. Tomchen1989 talk 18 53 16 November 2010 UTC I simply cannot advocate any argument for keep based on WP OTHERSTUFFEXISTS. In fact I am fully aware of the fact that this is a much bigger issue than this one article at least in my mind but I can t come here with 200 pages to delete. Sh i r ik Questions or Comments? 18 55 16 November 2010 UTC In a few months this is not going to be remembered at all seems to meet WP BIAS and WP CRYSTAL. Try to search google 上海大火 wikipedia . You re not sure whether Chinese and Hongkongese media will remember it. Tomchen1989 talk 19 22 16 November 2010 UTC Also as per WP OTHERSTUFFEXISTS Deletion of articles my OTHERSTUFFEXISTS may be valid because it can be demonstrated in the same way as I might demonstrate justification for the article s creation. It d be WP BIAS and not fair if deleted. Tomchen1989 talk 21 02 16 November 2010 UTC Keep It s just as much crystal balling to say that In a few months this is not going to be remembered at all as it is to say that it will be remembered. I d argue for the latter however based on the observation that skyscraper fires get written about more than most fires in large part because of the difficulty in fighting them and in rescuing people from them. . The lessons learned over the years from this type of fire have been part of the evolution of fire prevention and firefighting. Mandsford 19 01 16 November 2010 UTC If there are no specific WP guidelines on what constitutes a disaster in the encyclopedic sense such as a minimum death toll the article should remain along with the many other similar articles on incidents of relatively minor note. Tbmurray talk —Preceding undated comment added 19 41 16 November 2010 UTC . Keep. It has the references and therefore appears to pass WP GNG. SchuminWeb Talk 20 03 16 November 2010 UTC Keep. Fires of this scale with such a high death toll is rare. I m also asking for a speedy decsion on this since it has consensus for going on ITN at the main page. Kslotte talk 20 56 16 November 2010 UTC I also nominate that this be closed and the AfD tag be removed immediately. Not one editor has supported deletion.WP SNOW clearly applies here. Johnsemlak talk 21 04 16 November 2010 UTC Agreed this has become a pile on of keep votes. There is no other way that this can go besides keep as long as one is going based on consensus. I think we can safely put this AFD out of its misery. SchuminWeb Talk 04 38 17 November 2010 UTC Keep per Mandsford. Fires of this type have staying power of interest beyond merely news. Bearian talk 21 06 16 November 2010 UTC Keep per various of the above. I m hearing potentially 60+ deaths this is a large scale disaster and as such has interest merely beyond the ephemeral. Ser Amantio di Nicolao Che dicono a Signa? Lo dicono a Signa. 21 51 16 November 2010 UTC Keep it was considered notable enough for the front page. So its fairly clearly notable enough for an article. Eraserhead1 talk 22 28 16 November 2010 UTC I disagree with that rationale. IT was only considered notable enough for the front page by two people and an administrator who decided not to wait for consensus before posting on ITN. Strange Passerby talk • contribs 00 59 17 November 2010 UTC I disagree. There is consensus to post on ITN. I agree with someone said at WP ITN C Shanghai_fire respecting the intention of WP SK Procedural closure considered notable enough for the front page means considered notable enough to be an article at least before they ve cycled off the Main Page . Tomchen1989 talk 19 59 17 November 2010 UTC Delete WP NOTNEWS talk→ BWilkins ←track 22 31 16 November 2010 UTC Keep as has been established above this event is notable and has significant impact in China. Let s not turn this into another argument about systemic bias please. Strange Passerby talk • contribs 00 59 17 November 2010 UTC Strong keep. Fires and other incidents involving public buildings in China resulting in more than 50 deaths are quite uncommon and do not occur every year yet an image for this article would be helpful. For example though not a fire the collapse of a building in Shijiazhuang last year claimed 17 lives. The fire in Shanghai occurred in a very high population density residential metropolitan area in China s largest city comparable to the Beijing Television Cultural Center fire last year which killed one person yet has quite an extensive article. AH1 TCU 01 14 17 November 2010 UTC Keep per above. It is very rare that a fire results in this much damage and so many deaths it is also prompting Chinese authorities to implement stricter fire safety regulations. This is a significant event much more than NOTNEWS level and has received enough coverage to justify an article. It is not fair to say this fire will be forgotten in a few months because well it has not yet been a few months. ƒETCH COMMS 03 24 17 November 2010 UTC Strong keep. This is a significant if not historic event also 53+ people are dead let alone this was a rare fire that occurred in a skyscraper. You remove this article and this event will be forgotten. I also hate how and event in a second or third world country killing this many people is less important than an event killing a few or no people in Western Countries How is it the Connecticut Power plant explosion should be able to have an article when it had 5 death compared to 53 deaths in this fire Strongly reconsider this proposed deletion. Stormchaser89 talk 10 02pm 16 November 2010 US central standard time Keep. Major disaster. Compare this item with the minor news item being debated at WP Articles for deletion Datalink Computer Services incident. Abductive reasoning 06 51 17 November 2010 UTC Keep. Fires of a deadly nature which killed many people in this case should be recorded. It is notable enough for the world s media to put the spotlight on it otherwise they would not have reported it. The significance of this incident is not the just fire itself but the cause alleged improper conduct by workers or poor occupational health and safety. checked out 2010 San Bruno pipeline explosion. The casualties were 8 and this incident had 53+. So this should be included. Takamaxa talk 12 19 17 November 2010 UTC delete per not notable enough for an encyclopaedia. Wikinews would be better. Per Takamaxa it has got attention in the global media hence the case being that wikinews is perfect for it. Also WP OTHERCRAPEXISTS is not a reason to include it and god knows that should go too Lihaas talk 13 01 17 November 2010 UTC . Plz read WP OTHERCRAPEXISTS However such an argument may be perfectly valid if such can be demonstrated in the same way as one might demonstrate justification for an article s creation. It would be ridiculous to consider deleting an article on Yoda or Mace Windu for instance. If someone were as part of their reasoning for keep to say that every other main character in Star Wars has an article this may well be a valid point. But in WP ATA CRYSTAL I found an example not encouraged and comparable to the reason of our AfD here This celeb is just a flash in the pan and nobody will remember her in a week month year. Tomchen1989 talk 16 20 17 November 2010 UTC Keep If I may use the nominator s wording I fail to see how this is a non notable event in any sense of the word. Divebomb is not British 13 07 17 November 2010 UTC Keep Its rare that I disagree with WP NOTNEWS Arguments but it meets the criteria of WP NEWSEVENT in my book. I also have a strong feeling that had this been a 28 floor building in downtown Chicago New York City or LA We would not being having this discussion The Resident Anthropologist talk 13 14 17 November 2010 UTC I agree totally with you on that. Mandsford 16 56 17 November 2010 UTC WP NOTNEWS doesn t say that every news event should be excluded. WP Notability events shall be respected. As of now there have been 79 dead 36 missing and hundreds injured. The China s State Council named it 上海“11·15”特别重大火灾 literally Shanghai 11·15 particularly serious fire or Shanghai 11·15 particularly important fire it is thus officially tagged as notable now and it also meets WP GEOSCOPE events that have a demonstrable long term impact on a significant region of the world or a significant widespread societal group are presumed to be notable enough for an article. Tomchen1989 talk 15 15 17 November 2010 UTC Note This debate has been included in the list of China related deletion discussions. • Gene93k talk 16 03 17 November 2010 UTC Note This debate has been included in the list of News related deletion discussions. • Gene93k talk 16 03 17 November 2010 UTC Keep Only one question needs to be asked would this be deleted if it had happened in America? Oh look there s a flying pig. WP CSB. Black Kite t c 19 19 17 November 2010 UTC Then they probably would say No you can t mention the other articles you go against WP OTHERSTUFFEXISTS I can t come here with 200 pages to delete. WP OTHERCRAPEXISTS is not a reason... It s quite funny. A comparison to other articles of the same kind should be very reasonable here. Tomchen1989 talk 19 59 17 November 2010 UTC Snow Keep or Speedy keep This article was on WP ITN. User Shirik as an admin pulled it from ITN and started the AfD. Here I request a WP SNOW Keep or a WP Speedy keep due to the lack of discussion at WP Main Page Errors which goes against WP SK Applicability 5. The article is currently linked from the Main Page. In such a case please use Wikipedia Main Page Errors to have the link removed before nominating the article. then re add it to the ITN. It is quite annoying and a waste of time for the AfD.

He is portrayed by actor Simon Russell Beale. Towers is appointed after the election of the Conservative Liberal Democrat coalition government. In the tenth series he has Harry s tribunal stopped and reinstates him as Head of Section D. He reveals that this is because the death of Osama Bin Laden and the revolutions in the Middle East were causing a new chain of events that could end up with fundamentalist taking power and therefore declaring state support for terrorist organizations. As a bid to separate themselves from the US s negative image the UK is attending a secret summit with Russia to discuss a new special relationship between their two countries. Towers was responsible for bringing Ilya and Elena Gavrik into the country so as to prepare the negotiations. In the third episode he asks Ruth Evershed to dinner where he offers her a job as his new security adviser a job she accepts in episode four and takes up in the fifth episode. Although Towers is through and through a politician and clashes with Harry when intelligence matters rivals with the UK s current interests he is one of Harry s strongest allies and always indulges him as much as he can. He even said in their first meeting that he considered him a hero. It was only reluctuntly that Towers handed him over to the CIA in the tenth series and he promised to support him in whatever decision he made about his future at MI5 after Ruth s death.

Edward321 talk 12 15 19 November 2010 UTC I m not sure . Keep. Until recently the article Lakshadweep called this language Jeseri . I can t find anything related at Ethnologue but the name Jeseri is mentioned at india.gov.in in a context that seems relevant. So maybe this is not really a hoax but just a poorly referenced stub. Amir E. Aharoni talk 07 59 21 November 2010 UTC Keep but move to Jeseri language as that appears to be the most common form. It is generally difficult to find online sources beyond directory listings for these ultra small languages as the books generally tend to be obscure. It s also known as Dweep Bhasha and happens to be one of the two three principal languages of Lakshadweep depending on the source. . mdash Spaceman Spiff 07 24 22 November 2010 UTC I moved and changed my vote to Keep . It s not much but it s more than enough to show that this is not a hoax. Amir E. Aharoni talk 19 51 23 November 2010 UTC Delete Not a hoax maybe. Not notable surely. Sven Manguard Talk 06 16 24 November 2010 UTC Merge and Redirect to Lakshadweep. The sources presented by SpacemanSpiff show that it s a real language but right there doesn t seem to be enough material for more than a couple of sentences. If more sources pop up the article could be restarted. Pax Vobiscum talk 11 00 24 November 2010 UTC The above discussion is preserved as an archive of the debate. Please do not modify it.
